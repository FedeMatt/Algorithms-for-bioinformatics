## Algorithms for bioinformatics

In this project, I propose my solutions to the problems listed in Rosalind website (http://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/). I solve them at the end of each week of the *Algorithms for Bioinformatics* course at Helsinki University (Ms in Life Science Informatics).

Each problem is solved by implenting python functions.
